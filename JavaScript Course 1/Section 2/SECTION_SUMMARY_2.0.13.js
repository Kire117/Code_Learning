//Using variables, in other words, declaring, initializing, changing, or reading their values is an elementary part
//of practically every programming language.

//JavaScript is no exception, as you need to use variables to program in it.

//Remember to declare variables before using them. Pay attention to where you declare them – whether they are
//local or global.

//Try to use the keywords let and const, not the word var.


//Knowing the latter will be useful not for understanding the examples found in various sources, but rather so that
//you can avoid using it yourself.

//Remember not to use the same names for different variables, even if you declare them in different ranges.

//And, of course, give the variables names that will be related to what you want to store in them – the code should
//be readable not only to the interpreter, but also to people.
