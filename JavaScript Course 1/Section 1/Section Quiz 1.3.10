Question 4: We can pass several arguments to console.log separated by commas, e.g.:

console.log("abc", "def", "ghi");
Output information about yourself to the console in the format: Name Surname (Year) e.g. Mary Stuart (1542).

giving all the information as one argument;
giving the name, surname, and year as separate arguments.


console.log("Mary Stuart (1542)"); console.log("Mary", "Stuart", "(1542)");

Question 5: Output the same information (name, surname, year) to the console, not side by side, but on consecutive lines.


console.log("Mary"); console.log("Stuart"); console.log("(1542)");

Question 6: A string can be concatenated using the + sign, for example "abc" + "def" will be treated as "abcdef". Try writing your name, surname, and year of birth on one line again, this time not separated by commas, but by + signs.


console.log("Mary" + "Stuart" + "(1542)");

Question 7: Put spaces in the appropriate places, so that when displayed, you get the same effect as in Question 4.


console.log("Mary" + "Stuart" + "(1542)");
