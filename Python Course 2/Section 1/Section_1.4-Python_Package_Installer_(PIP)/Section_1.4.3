1.4.3 How to install pip
The question that should be put now is: how to get a proper cheese knife? In other words, how to ensure
that pip is installed and ready to work?

The most precise answer is “it depends”. Really.

Some Python installations come with pip, some don't. What’s more, it doesn’t only depend on the OS you use,
although this is a very important factor.

Let's start with MS Windows.

The MS Windows Python installer already contains pip, and so no other steps need to be taken in order to install it.
Unfortunately, if the PATH variable is misconfigured, pip may unavailable.

To verify that we haven’t misled you, try to do this:

open the Windows console (CMD or PowerShell, whatever you prefer)
execute the following command:
pip --version

in the most optimistic scenario (and we really want that to happen) you’ll see something like this:
the absence of this message may mean that the PATH variable either incorrectly points to the location of the
Python binaries, or doesn't point to it at all; for example, our PATH variable contains the following substring:
C:\Program Files\Python3\Scripts\;C:\Program Files\Python3\;

the easiest way to reconfigure the PATH variable is to reinstall Python, instructing the installer to set it for you.
