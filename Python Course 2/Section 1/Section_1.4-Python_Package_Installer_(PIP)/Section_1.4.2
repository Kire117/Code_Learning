1.4.2 The PyPI repo: the Cheese Shop

The PyPI repo is sometimes referred to as the Cheese Shop. Really.

Does that sound a little strange to you? Don't worry, it’s all perfectly innocent.

We refer to the repo as a shop, because you go there for the same reasons you go to other shops: to fulfill your needs.
If you want some cheese, you go to the cheese shop. If you want a piece of software, you go to the software shop.
Fortunately, the analogy ends here – you don't need any money to take some software out of the repo shop.

PyPI is completely free, and you can just pick a code and use it – you’ll encounter neither cashier nor security guard.
Of course, it doesn't absolve you from being polite and honest. You have to obey all the licensing terms,
so don't forget to read them.

“OK”, you say, “the shop is clear now, but what does cheese have to do with Python?”

The Cheese Shop is one of the most famous Monty Python sketches. It depicts the surrealist adventure of an
Englishman trying to buy some cheese. Unfortunately, the shop he visits (immodestly named Ye National Cheese Emporium)
has no cheese in stock at all.

Of course, it's meant to be ironic. As you already know, PyPI has lots of software in stock and it's available 24/7.
It's fully entitled to identify itself as Ye International Python Software Emporium.

PyPI is a very specific shop, not just because it offers all its products for free. It also requires a special
tool to make use of it.

Fortunately, this tool is also free, so if you want to make your own digital cheeseburger by using the goods
 offered by the PyPI Shop, you’ll need a free tool named pip.

No, you haven't misheard. Just pip. It's another acronym, of course, but its nature is more complex
than the previously mentioned PyPI, as it's an example of a recursive acronym, which means that the acronym
refers to itself, which means that explaining it is an infinite process.

Why? Because pip means “pip installs packages”, and the pip inside “pip installs packages” means
“pip installs packages” and ...

Let’s stop there. Thank you for your cooperation.

By the way, there are a few other very famous recursive acronyms. One of them is Linux,
which can be interpreted as “Linux is Not Unix”.
