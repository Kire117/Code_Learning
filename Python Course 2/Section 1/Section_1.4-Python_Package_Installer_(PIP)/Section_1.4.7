# 1.4.7 Use pip!
Pip's capabilities don't end here, but the command set we've presented to you is enough to start successfully
managing packages that aren't a part of the regular Python installation.

We hope we’ve encouraged you to carry out your own experiments with pip and the Python package universe.
PyPI invites you to dive into its extensive resources.

Some say that one of the most important programming virtues is laziness. Don't get us wrong –
we don't want you to spend all day napping on the couch and dreaming of Python code.

A lazy programmer is a programmer who looks for existing solutions and analyzes the available code
before they start to develop their own software from scratch.

This is why PyPI and pip exist – use them!
